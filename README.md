# Pyminisat: A Python package for simulating optical intersatellite links in a minisat constellation

## What is it all about?
This repo contains the minisat `Python` package which can be used to simulate optical intersatellite links in a minisat (Starlink-like) constellation. The code is writter by Mr. Michalis Gioulis and Prof. Thomas Kamalakis both affiliated with Harokopio University of Athens, Department of Informatics and Telematics. The code is available under the MIT open-source licence.

You will need to install `numpy`, `scipy` and `matplotlib` in order to get this to work. To install this in a virtual environment you will first need to install `python-pip`. On Debian-based distributions simply issue:
```
sudo apt install python3-pip
```
Then install the `virtualenv` package using
```
pip3 install venv
```
or if you are on an externally managed environment, use:
```
sudo apt install python3-venv
```
In a folder of your choosing, clone the repo using
```
git clone https://github.com/thomaskamalakis/pyminisat
