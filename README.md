## What is it all about?
This repo contains the minisat `Python` package which can be used to simulate optical intersatellite links in a minisat (Starlink-like) constellation. The code is writter by Mr. Michalis Gioulis and Prof. Thomas Kamalakis both affiliated with Harokopio University of Athens, Department of Informatics and Telematics.
